        <h1>A Brief History of Golf</h1>
        <h2>⛳ A Brief History of Golf</h2>

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>Golf as we know it today originated in <strong>Scotland in the 15th century</strong>. Early versions of
            similar stick-and-ball games existed in <strong>medieval Europe and Asia</strong>, but the Scots are
            credited with developing the modern game.</p>
        <p>The first documented mention of golf was in <strong>1457</strong>, when King James II of Scotland banned it
            because it was distracting soldiers from archery practice.</p>

        <h2>Development of the Game</h2>
        <p>By the early 1500s, the ban was lifted, and golf gained popularity, especially among the Scottish elite.</p>
        <p><strong>St. Andrews</strong>, often called the “Home of Golf,” established its famous course in the
            mid-1500s. It's one of the oldest and most iconic courses in the world.</p>
        <p>The game spread to <strong>England</strong> in the 17th century and continued to grow internationally.</p>

        <h2>Rules and Structure</h2>
        <p>The <strong>first official rules of golf</strong> were written in <strong>1744</strong> by the Honourable
            Company of Edinburgh Golfers.</p>
        <p>The <strong>18-hole standard</strong> was established at St. Andrews in 1764 and eventually became the norm
            worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Global Expansion</h2>
        <p>In the <strong>19th century</strong>, golf expanded to <strong>North America, Australia, and other parts of
                the British Empire</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>United States Golf Association (USGA)</strong> was founded in 1894, and the <strong>first U.S.
                Open</strong> was held in 1895.</p>

        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        <p>Golf became a major professional sport in the 20th century, with legends like <strong>Bobby Jones, Arnold
                Palmer, Jack Nicklaus</strong>, and <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> helping to popularize the game
            globally.</p>
        <p>It was reintroduced to the <strong>Olympics in 2016</strong>, after being absent since 1904.</p>
